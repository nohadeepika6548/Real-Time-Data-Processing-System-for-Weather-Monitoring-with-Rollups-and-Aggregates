Daily Weather Summary
Data Aggregation Logic

Roll up weather data for each day to calculate:
Average Temperature: Helps understand the general temperature trend.
Maximum Temperature: Indicates peak heat levels, critical for health and safety.
Minimum Temperature: Shows the lowest temperature, important for assessing cold conditions.
Dominant Weather Condition:
Reason: The most frequent weather condition provides insight into typical daily weather patterns, influencing activities, planning, and alerts.
Database Schema for Daily Summaries

CREATE TABLE daily_weather_summary (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    date DATE,
    avg_temp DECIMAL(5, 2),
    max_temp DECIMAL(5, 2),
    min_temp DECIMAL(5, 2),
    dominant_condition VARCHAR(50),
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

Daily Aggregation Implementation
def aggregate_daily_weather_data(connection):
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    query = """
    INSERT INTO daily_weather_summary (date, avg_temp, max_temp, min_temp, dominant_condition)
    SELECT 
        date_trunc('day', dt) AS date,
        AVG(temp) AS avg_temp,
        MAX(temp) AS max_temp,
        MIN(temp) AS min_temp,
        (SELECT main FROM weather_data 
         WHERE dt::date = date_trunc('day', dt) 
         GROUP BY main 
         ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC LIMIT 1) AS dominant_condition
    FROM weather_data
    WHERE created_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '1 day'
    GROUP BY date_trunc('day', dt);
    """
    cursor.execute(query)
    connection.commit()
    cursor.close()

Alerting Thresholds
User-Configurable Thresholds
Allow users to define thresholds for:
Temperature (e.g., alert if temperature exceeds 35°C).
Specific weather conditions (e.g., alerts for rain).
Tracking Logic

thresholds = {
    'temp_max': 35,
    'condition': 'Rain'
}

def check_alerts(current_temp, current_condition, previous_temp, previous_condition):
    if current_temp > thresholds['temp_max'] and previous_temp > thresholds['temp_max']:
        return f"Alert! Temperature exceeded {thresholds['temp_max']}°C"
    if current_condition == thresholds['condition']:
        return f"Alert! Current condition is {thresholds['condition']}"
    return None

Alert Triggering
Implement alert mechanisms to log or send notifications when thresholds are breached.
Console and Email Alerts: Use libraries like smtplib for email notifications.


Implement Visualizations
Dashboard Setup
Create visual components to display:
Daily weather summaries (bar charts for temperature).
Historical trends (line charts for temperature over time).
Alerts triggered during observation periods.
Example Visualization with Matplotlib

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def plot_daily_summary(daily_data):
    dates = [data['date'] for data in daily_data]
    avg_temps = [data['avg_temp'] for data in daily_data]
    max_temps = [data['max_temp'] for data in daily_data]
    min_temps = [data['min_temp'] for data in daily_data]

    plt.plot(dates, avg_temps, label='Average Temperature')
    plt.plot(dates, max_temps, label='Max Temperature')
    plt.plot(dates, min_temps, label='Min Temperature')
    plt.xlabel('Date')
    plt.ylabel('Temperature (°C)')
    plt.title('Daily Weather Summary')
    plt.legend()
    plt.show()


Test Cases
1. System Setup

Verify system starts successfully and connects to the OpenWeatherMap API using a valid API key.
2. Data Retrieval

Simulate API calls at configurable intervals.
Ensure the system retrieves weather data for specified locations and parses the response correctly.
3. Temperature Conversion

Test conversion of temperature values from Kelvin to Celsius (or Fahrenheit) based on user preference.
4. Daily Weather Summary

Simulate a sequence of weather updates over several days.
Verify that daily summaries are calculated correctly (average, maximum, minimum temperatures, and dominant weather condition).
5. Alerting Thresholds

Define and configure user thresholds for temperature or weather conditions.
Simulate weather data exceeding or breaching thresholds.
Verify that alerts are triggered only when thresholds are violated.
5. Bonus Features
Support Additional Weather Parameters
Extend to include humidity, wind speed, etc., in rollups/aggregates.
Forecast Retrieval and Summaries
Incorporate weather forecasts from the OpenWeatherMap API and generate summaries based on predicted conditions.
